<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<h2>What do you use to make music?</h2>
<h4>fl studio, and free soundfonts online, usually from video games.</h4><br>
<h2>What if I can't pay you right away?</h2>
<h4>then i won't make your music. but you can just ask once you get the required money.</h4><br>
<h2>Can I pay you in exposure????</h2>

<h2>RECENT TRACKS:</h2>
<h6>(p.s. hover over the names for commentary.)</h6>
<h6>(p.p.s. if a song goes on for another 10-30 seconds with nothing but silence, blame fl studio. it's supposed to STOP, but it keeps going on until sound is 100% zero. don't worry, you're not missing any song.)</h6>
<h6>*the date created, most recent date modified, and time that i posted it on discord are all different. the song could have been changed severely within the modified date (not shown) and created date (which i know is 100% the case for "sector_1" and "Fate").</h6>
