<p class="a">(p.s. hover over the names for commentary.)</p>
<p class="a">(p.p.s. if a song goes on for another 10-30 seconds with nothing but silence, blame fl studio. it's supposed to STOP, but it keeps going on until sound is 100% zero. don't worry, you're not missing any song.)</p>
<p class="a">*the date created, most recent date modified, and time that i posted it on discord are all different. the song could have been changed severely within the modified date (not shown) and created date (which i know is 100% the case for "sector_1" and "Fate").</p>
