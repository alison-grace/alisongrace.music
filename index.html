====  02/07/2020 - happy... valentines day? MUSIC,  ====
<br>====  github, and a thank you to mspfa!  ====<br>
mspfa's 10th anniversary was three days ago (also sweetnote day), and i just wanna give a shoutout to the mspfa discord. you guys rock. i love all of you, you're all really nice and accepting of me, even when i was a HUGE jerk when i joined. let us all drink out of our caprisuns as i make a cheers to you guys. <3
EXCEPT FOR YOU, WILL. I HATE YOU.

also music!! i've finally added the music section, which has some details on how to commission me, general rules for commissioning, and a BUNCH of sample songs! i think i'll try to consistantly upload any good songs i make onto here (but i won't make an update every time hehe)

ALSO, GITHUB!!!!!! we still haven't gotten that .com yet (it's up for sale. i just need to figure out how to host my html on it...), but this is WAY better than pipe.miroware/kasfjaiushfaoushfiuanwdiua! kevenandsoki.github.io... simple. easy. good.

anyways that's all, i hope you guys have a good day today!

<br>====  and the future of the site!  ====<br>
hehe, I guess not really .com YET, but hey. whatever works. 
   
this is keven speaking to you from this website. here's update v1.0! i've added a link to ms paint guy, removed messaging because i still haven't figured out how to code it, and added way more games. check some of them out. they're awesome. 
   
also, read sweetnote!! i'll probably post updates about what's going on with sweetnote. i'm just having a bit of trouble with a room, is all. plus, this month's been busy. 
   
also, MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
